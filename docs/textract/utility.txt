[INTRO]

TEXtract is a utility that extracts a list of textures from a set of WAD 
files and puts them in another WAD file. It will extract what is on the 
provided list, as well as attempt to pull textures that it knows are parts of
animated textures and switches, and if it can't find those, it will attempt
to pull an ANIMATED or SWITCHES lump to get that information.

It will extract TEXTUREx, PNAMES, patches, flats between F_ or FF_ markers 
and textures between TX_ markers in WAD files. Nothing else.

The list for what to extract is read from STDIN. The list may be terminated
with "-end" or the EOF character (Ctrl-Z on Windows, Ctrl-D on Linux/Unix/
OSX).

[CHANGELOG]

0.9.7BETA
	Asymmetrical lump markers used to denote flats and patches are now 
		detectable.
	Known "Null" textures will always sort first in TEXTURE1, unless the
		-nulltex switch is specified with a specific name. 
		
0.9.6BETA
	Fixed a NullPointer which would occur if the source texture resource WAD 
		did not contain a set of TEXTUREx/PNAMES lumps. How embarassing.
	Added reminder message to error message on a bad input list parse.
	Special thanks to DoomWorld user plums!
		
0.9.5BETA
	Fixed a bug where it wouldn't detect namespace boundaries if they were
		the first entry in a WAD file. Whoops. Greater OR EQUAL, Matt...

0.9.4BETA
	Added an optional "-owrite" switch for forcing overwrite of the target 
		output WAD.

0.9.3BETA
	Put "BETA" in the version to make it a proper "beta".
	If a WAD wasn't found (and can't be created), this would just end. Now it 
		outputs an error message.
	In some cases, TEXtract would not export the data correctly. Now it does.

0.9.2.1
	Minor change in source code.

0.9.2
	Changed ordering of how lumps are written to output wads.
	Made sure that textures are written back in alphabetical order - not
		doing that may break animations, maybe not, but I'm a tad anal about 
		it anyway.
	ANIMATED now exports correctly (more correctly than before).
	Fixed internal animation table.
	
0.9.1
	Fixed issue where textures that used multiples of the same patch would 
		duplicate patch entries in the output.

0.9
	First BETA Release

[HOW TO USE]

Upon execution, TEXtract does the following:

1. Read and catalogue the textures and flats that it finds in each input wad,
   including the base WAD specified by the "-base" switch (which is 
   mandatory).

2. Reads a list from STDIN of all textures and flats to extract until it hits 
   the "-end" marker (or EOF). Textures are started with "-texture", flats
   with "-flat".
   
	Example:
	
	-TEXTURE
	ADEL_B15
	ADEL_D11
	ADEL_D15
	ADEL_G01
	ADEL_M07
	ADEL_Q05
	ADEL_Q60
	ADEL_RR2
	-FLAT
	A-DAN1
	A-DAN3
	ADEL_F47
	ADEL_F67
	ADEL_F71
	ADEL_F72
	ADEL_F75
	ADEL_F76
	ADEL_F80
	ADEL_F81
	ADEL_F82
	-END

   All lines in the list are interpreted case-insensitively. "BLOOD1" is the 
   same as "blood1". 

3. Copies the TEXTUREx and PNAMES lump from the base WAD into the output WAD
   (the file after "-o" on the command line) and then looks through the 
   provided WAD files for replaced and new textures/flats to put in the new
   or existing WAD.
   
   WARNING: Multiple uses of an existing WAD for dumping textures may not be
   desirable, due to the way it is extracted and dumped to it. It may be
   easier to dump to a new wad, then merge it in with another WAD. It may be
   safer to output to a new wad plus using the -owrite switch.
   
   Texture precedence is defined by the order of the WADs provided, and
   TEXTUREx lumps before TX_ namespaces. If one patch is replaced in a 
   texture that exists in the base, the whole texture is replaced.
