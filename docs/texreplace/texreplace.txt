TEXREPLACE by Matt Tropiano

A Java-based command-line utility  that takes a wad file, an "out" wad file 
location, and a lump name.

The lump name and "out" file are optional - the "out" file defaults to 
"out.wad" unless specified, and the lump will be the first map lump found 
unless specified.

The list of replacement entries are to be specified via standard in, so you 
can either type them in line by line at the prompt, or feed it a textfile via 
standard in redirect.

For example, the command line could look like:

    texreplace in.wad out.wad E1M1 < entries.txt

The contents of the script would take these commands:

textures - start texture entries.
flats    - start flat entries.
end      - stop reading input (must be present, or it will wait for additional input).

Each entry should be in pairs of TEXTURE1, TEXTURE2.

An example file would be:

	textures
	midbars3 railing
	firelav2 firelava
	zimmer1 zimmer2
	flats
	ceil5_2 f_sky1
	grass1 grass2
	fwater1 blood1
	end

Any line that is blank or starts with a "#" is skipped.
