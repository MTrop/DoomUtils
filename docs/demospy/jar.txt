[RUNNING THIS PROGRAM]

This version of DemoSpy requires four libraries:

Black Rook Commons
Black Rook Commons I/O
Black Rook Commons Lang
Black Rook Doom Struct

All downloadable at:
http://blackrooksoftware.com/downloads.htm 

Be sure that you have Java installed (or its binaries are on your PATH), and
have the required libraries in your CLASSPATH, and then type:

java -jar mtrop-utils-demospy.jar

If you do not have all of the libraries in a CLASSPATH environment variable,
then you will have to type:

java -cp [PATH TO JARS HERE] -jar mtrop-utils-demospy.jar
