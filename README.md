### Contents

This contains a series of utilities requested by people on Doomworld. Some are missing from the last version because they weren't too useful.

- **DemoSpy** - Detect/view DEMO lump characteristics.
- **DoomMerge** - Merges WADs together in a scripted manner.
- **DoomSND** - WAV to Doom Sound Converter.
- **MapCount** - Map entry counter (for ZIPS, PK3s, and WADs).
- **MapSwap** - Switch map-specific entries to another map slot.
- **PalCnvrt** - Converts graphics from one palette/colormap to another, preserving "fullbright" colors.
- **ThingSpy** - Output or search for thing editor numbers by map lump.
- **TexSpy** - Scans for used texture names in maps.
- **TEXtract** - Extracts textures from texture packs. Detects animated texture names (both built-in and from ANIMATED/SWITCHES).
